Created as a project for ENG-170 Summer 2024. Based on the myth of Mimir's Head and Odin's Eye, this game depicts Mimir's Well which was known for it's wisdom-inducing properties. In order to allow Odin to drink from the well and gain the wisdom, Mimir required Odin to give up one of his eyes for the privilege. When reading this myth, I was distinctly reminded of the Magic 8 Ball toy from my childhood as I saw it as a magic ball of wisdom. I thought of creating something similar, but in the vein of Ancient Norse wisdom. Therefore, this game will show Gjallerhorn (a horn previously used for drinking the well water until given to Heimdall, Guadian of the Gate) filled with a mysterious liquid and an eyeball floating inside. The well itself looks mystical with multiple moving elements to simulate the magic. When loaded into a program capable of Python gaming, there will be a button to "Drink from Mimir's Well" in which a response will "magically" appear in the well. You can restart and play to your heart's content; though there are limited responses, it's completely randomized so you may have trouble seeing all of them unless you're very determined!

In order to play this game, here are the following steps:

  1. Install the latest update of Python which you can find here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
  2. Download the required modules _tkinter, Pillow, and requests_. For ease of use, I included a requirements.txt file which once downloaded to your computer, you can open up Command Prompt (Windows Program), type in `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3. Once everything, including the code and gifs are downloaded, be sure to have them in the same directory. This means the files should be in something like C:\Users\YourName\norse_8_ball with GIFS being a folder inside of that one. If you're installing into another folder like Documents, just include that after your name in the directory.
     
     > ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó **It's extremely important to have everything in the directory properly otherwise the code will not work.**
     
  4. From there, I usually go to the Command Prompt and open the directory I put my files in. To do that, type `cd norse_8_Ball` or `cd Documents\norse_8_ball`. It should then open up that specific directory. You can check everything is inside by typing `dir` in Command Prompt. If everything looks good, then....
  5. Finally, type the following code in `python norse_8_ball.py` in Command Prompt and the game window should pop up!

If you have any trouble with the game, Google is a great resource üòâ, but I'm also happy to help my fellow classmates! Also, let me know of any other good Ancient Norse wisdom to include and maybe I'll manage to add it!


Special thanks to my friend Michael P. who helped fix all the errors in `first_iteration.py`, making it a functional piece of code! Although I ended up changing a lot and almost giving up completely, it was your patience, time, and conversation that helped push me through! Thank you for taking the time to help and listen to me rant. 
It is still a functional game so you can check that out too if you wish.
